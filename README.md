# Tagsonomy
Carrying Forward Tagsonomania

A successfully open, extensible and scalable system of tags would include three core URLs (or URIs) to:

1) The ID  of the entity that applied the tag;   
2) The applicable tag definition from the authoritative source; and    
3) The object to which the tag was applied. 

See the [project wiki for more on this](https://github.com/collabx/Tagsonomy/wiki/Purpose-of-URLs-for-the-Tag,-Tagger-and-Tag-Set), watch this repository as the project unfolds and please jump right in with your pull requests or other contributions!
